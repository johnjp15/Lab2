**a link to my fork:** https://github.com/johnjp15/Lab2Fork-101
 
**a link to my pull request:** https://github.com/UVA-CS3240-S18/Lab2Fork-101/pull/9
  
**what improvement and why:** I added additional checks to see if is_square is still true before checking to see if the later rows and columns work. This reduces the number of unnecessary checks if is_square was already made false by a previous row or column.
